Main Idea: Show the progression of an artist's album's feature(s) over the course of the years.

- Search for an artist by it's name
	// - Pick the first one that we get back
	- Allow the user to pick from the response list (limit:  3-5 tbd)
- User can toggle the visibility of a feature in the graph
- Graph can show as many as 3 features at a time (Value tbd)
- The albums will be shown on the  timeline spaced out as by their release date rather than equal spacing
	- (optional) Allow toggle for equal spacing
- Somehow mark the most popular album
- Somehow display the tracks of an album
	- (optional) Highlight the most popular song
- The x axis will show the release date
- The y axis will show the value.
	-  The y axis label will represent the value in words (not danceable, very danceable...)
- (optional) Allow BPM as a feature and scale the other values accordingly 
- A datapoint in the graph will be shown as a thumbnail of the cover art
- (Hovering a datapoint will show the larger cover art
	- Also all the other features will be shown while hovering
	- (optional) toggle features
	-  The feature description will represent the value in words (not danceable, very danceable...) but also as the correct numerical value)

- There should be a possibility on showing the feature values for each album

- (optional) Showdown between two artists as a completely different functionality
	- (optional) using showdown should disable the selection of multiple features
